Hi, my name is Maksim Gramin. I am a software engineer, consultant, and researcher with a passion for database technologies and SQL. I have extensive experience working with various database systems. In the past, I have worked as a SQL developer on large distributed teams, implementing complex business logic on the database side. Additionally, I have experience as a Java developer and team leader, where we built monolithic and microservices applications and interacted with databases mainly through ORM or similar tools. I am excited to share my experience and develop tools and systems to simplify and enhance working with data.

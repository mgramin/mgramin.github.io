Hi, my name is Maksim Gramin. I'm a software engeneer, consultant and researcher passionate about database technologies and SQL. I have spent a lot of time working with various database systems. I was a SQL-developer on big distributed teams, implementing tons of complex business logic on a database side. And I worked as a classical Java developer and a team leader where we built monolith and microservices applications and interacted with any databases mainly through ORM or something like that. And I do want to share my experience and create tools and systems for simpler and more efficient work with data.

It is considered an ancient and difficult to understand language, designed for special secret engineers with special secret skills. In this way, a mere mortal should not write SQL queries and should rely on special tools. And we are used to the fact that almost all ORM, DB managers, monitoring tools, and other DB tools generate tons of &amp;ldquo;tricky&amp;rdquo; queries against our data, turning SQL into dumb bytecode.</description></item><item><title>Cloudy with a chance of databases</title><link>https://gramin.pro/posts/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-databases/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 12:56:38 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://gramin.pro/posts/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-databases/</guid><description>Michael Stonebraker is a live legend, godfather of databases, relational patriarch, Miles Davis in the database World. He stood at the database roots in the 70s and to this day he stays on the bleeding edge of data technologies. Today we will review his keynote &amp;ldquo;The cloud in your feature&amp;rdquo; from an online conference Postgres Build 2021.
All goes to the clouds When you try to hide hardware, wires and pipes under the floor in your office in central London or Frankfurt, cloud guys from Microsoft Azure box up data centers in standard 40 foot shipping containers and drop them around the World in places with cheap power.</description></item><item><title>What is SQL now?</title><link>https://gramin.pro/posts/what-is-sql-now/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 12:56:38 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://gramin.pro/posts/what-is-sql-now/</guid><description>SQL is Esperanto in the data world. But unlike &amp;ldquo;Lingwe Uniwersala&amp;rdquo; SQL became world-known and really common.
Initially SQL was invented in 70 special for databases. Even then its creators aimed to create a simple and powerful data language for a wide range of users, with not only IT background, such as engineers, scientists, researchers, analytics, managers etc. SQL first of all was made by humans for humans, not for machines.</description></item></channel></rss>
